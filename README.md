A Single Page Application built with ReactJS. It allows people to conveniently see what concerts/live music events are being held in their area or any area they wish to search. Users are given a list of music events, and are able to add individual artists to an integrated Spotify playlist. The playlist will enable the user to hear the top three most popular songs from each artist in order to make a decision about which one they want to see that night. It is meant for last-minute impulse decisions to go out, so the UI/UX was crafted with simplicity, urgency and ease of use in mind. 

Users can search by either dragging the map, or by the search bar. When a query is fetched, a grid of shows are shown to the user. 

Search queries can be filtered by: 

1. Location
2. Date
3. Genre
4. Price

The app fetches location and map information from the Google Maps Javascript API, and whenever a location search is made, the map moves to that location. The app then fetches event data in that area and displays the events as markers on the map as well as a grid list on the right panel.
